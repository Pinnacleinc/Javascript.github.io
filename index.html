<h2>ADVERT</h2>
<p>The AIS Organising Committee is seeking volunteers from the community to join the AIS Programme Committee.

The programme committee is responsible for developing the agenda of the annual AIS event that includes the agenda of the AfNOG Conference and the AFRINIC Public Policy Meeting. </p>

 

<h2>Eligibilty</h2> 
<p>
Anyone interested in Internet development and who is willing to volunteer some time and expertise to the  AIS event can apply. There are no restrictions, be it age, geography, stakeholder group, affiliation, etc</p>
<h2>Deploy IPv6 Now</h2>
<p>
Africa has one of the worldâ€™s highest rates of mobile Internet users and a huge population of future Internet users waiting to get online. More and more IP addresses will be needed to facilitate Internet access across the region. As AFRINIC's supply of IPv4 address space continues to dwindle, new connections will increasingly be made over IPv6 as opposed to IPv4, especially in those regions where IPv4 address space has already been exhausted.

By design, computers using IPv4 and IPv6 cannot communicate directly with each other. Devices connecting to the Internet with only an IPv4 address cannot communicate with devices that are connecting with only an IPv6 address. In order to ensure that networks continue to run seamlessly and all devices around the world can continue to communicate with each other, IPv6 must be deployed in parallel with IPv4. This means that IPv4 and IPv6 will coexist and be operated in parallel for the time it takes to fully deploy IPv6 on a global scale. It is now becoming imperative that African network operators also start the transition to IPv6 as soon as possible to ensure they can continue communicating with IPv4 and IPv6 networks in other regions. This is the only way to guarantee that all Internet users will be able to freely access the global Internet from Africa and to ensure that Africa remains a global player in online world.
IPv4 Transfer

Some of the other RIRs have policies in place that cater for transfer of IPv4 address space within, as well as to and from, their respective regions. Currently, there are no approved policies for the transfer of IPv4 address space allocated by AFRINIC, either within or in/out of the AFRINIC region. Please see our Policy Proposal page for more information about proposals currently under discussion.</p></div>
